Low level, video friendly modal component

Typically, you avoid using the VideoModal component directly, and instead use [YouTubeVideoModal](/components/content/YouTubeVideoModal).

If you're using a different video host, we recommend you contribute that component here.

Animates the video in, which requires you to give the modal a poster, which is a temporary image shown before the animation has completed. This is to avoid jank while the animation is taking place and the video is loading.

**Note:** To use this component in your application, you need to install [neptune-css](https://transferwise.github.io/neptune-web/about/Setup) and [@transferwise/icons@1.5.0](https://github.com/transferwise/icons)

<LiveEditorBlock code={code} scope={{ VideoModal }} />
