/**
 * This defines the layout of the docs page, which has two columns and a content panel.
 *
 * Items at the top level will appear in the first, leftmost column. They must have a title and
 * provide dir - the directory where content files live.
 *
 * If you want to group content, you can specify groups by providing a children property. This
 * should be an array of groups, each with a title and dir.
 *
 * By default, files will appear in alphabetical order. To specify an order, use the fileOrder
 * property inside a group, and pass the file names (without extension) in the order you'd like
 * them to appear.
 *
 * Note that you cannot mix groups and individual files - if you decide to use groups, all children
 * files in that section must be in a group.
